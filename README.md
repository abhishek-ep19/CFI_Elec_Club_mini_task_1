### 1. Receiving Images From Passing Weather Satellites (NOAA and METEOR M2) Using a Cheap SDR
  First, we need radio antenna to receive the signal and an SDR (Software Defined Radio) attached to it. In SDR, the receiver would be connected to analog-to-digital converter. Then the digital signal-processor would read the converter & do the required processing, i.e. to filter or compress the data stream according to the needs. To build the antenna at least 10 feet of 50ohm coaxial cable, 8 pieces cut to 21 inches long wire & some other stuffs like wood, soldering iron, etc would be required.

A double cross antenna is 4 dipole antennas mounted together (a dipole antenna being just 2 pieces of bare wire), one at each cardinal direction and tipped at an angle. This allows the antenna to be omnidirectional and receive signals regardless of where the satellite is in the sky. The dipoles are mounted at an angle to the axis of the pole(see next section) because the signal from the satellites is right hand circularly polarized.

To control SDR we need software like  SDRSharp (SDRSharp does not require installer). Since the satellites that we're interested in are in polar orbit (they orbit the earth around the poles) we can't listen for them whenever we want. Now, we have to receive signal from them only when the satellite is overhead. This means we now need a tracker to figure out where they are.
